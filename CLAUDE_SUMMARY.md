# Project Summary for Claude

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js TypeScript application for Last Straw Farms to research competitive landscape for their cut flower business. The application uses:
- Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Prisma for database operations
- Google Maps API (via MCP server) for geocoding and place search
- Leaflet for map visualization

## Current State
- The application has a functional structure with API routes, components, and database schema
- Scripts for fetching florist data and seeding the database are working
- The application successfully fetches and displays 20 real florists within 50 miles of Last Straw Farms
- The database is successfully seeded with real florist data, including territories and routes
- Maps functionality has been fixed to properly handle initialization and cleanup

## Recent Work Completed
- Fixed TypeScript errors in seed-database.ts and seed-direct.js
- Resolved module resolution issues with ES modules and TypeScript
- Created a dedicated tsconfig.json for the scripts directory
- Modified populate-database.js to use working JavaScript implementations
- Updated package.json scripts to use JavaScript files for database operations
- Created CHANGELOG.md to track project changes
- Fixed map initialization issues using useUnmount hook and proper cleanup
- Implemented unique IDs for map instances to prevent conflicts

## Real Florist Data Integration
The application now successfully fetches real florist data from the Google Maps API:
1. The Google Maps API integration has been completed by implementing direct API calls
2. The fetch-florists.js script successfully retrieves 20 real florists within 50 miles of Last Straw Farms
3. The API routes use the Google Maps API directly for geocoding and place search
4. The database is successfully seeded with the real florist data, including territories and routes

## Google Maps API Limitations
When comparing the application's results with direct Google Maps searches, there are discrepancies in the number of florists found. This is due to several factors:

1. **API Endpoint Limitations**: The application uses the Places API Text Search endpoint, which returns a maximum of 20 results per page.

2. **No Pagination Implementation**: The current implementation doesn't fetch additional pages of results using the `next_page_token` parameter.

3. **Query Specificity**: The application uses a simple "florist" query, which might not capture all types of flower shops that Google Maps would include in a direct search.

4. **Different Search Algorithms**: Google Maps web interface likely uses more sophisticated algorithms and has access to more data than what's available through the API.

5. **Business Categories**: Some businesses like "Solabee Flowers & Botanicals" might be categorized differently or have multiple categories that aren't captured by a simple "florist" query.

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhance Florist Data Collection
- Implement pagination to fetch more than 20 results using the `next_page_token` parameter
- Expand search queries to include related terms like "flower shop", "botanical", "floral design"
- Use the Google Maps Places API's Nearby Search endpoint as an alternative approach
- Consider using the Google Maps Places API's Find Place endpoint to look up specific businesses by name
- Implement a more sophisticated distance calculation to ensure all businesses within the radius are captured

### 2. Improve Map Functionality
- Add clustering for markers when many florists are in close proximity
- Implement custom markers with different colors based on territories
- Add info windows with more details when clicking on markers
- Implement territory visualization with polygons or circles

### 3. Enhance User Interface
- Fix remaining NextJS warnings about synchronous use of searchParams
- Implement better filtering and sorting options for the florist list
- Add a detail view for each florist with more information
- Implement a comparison view for multiple florists

### 4. Add Business Intelligence Features
- Implement analytics for tracking market coverage
- Add competitor analysis tools
- Create reports for business decision making
- Implement data visualization for market trends
